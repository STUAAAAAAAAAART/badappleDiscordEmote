## cutListInput.py
manual console line input, to convert cuts in the premiere sequence into a JSON file

## cutFile.json
this is that JSON file

## imgPreviewer.py
a rudimentary animation playback previewer made by repurposing a tiny bit of OpenCV. displays a specific intermediary frame when required by the reading loop after the frame enumerator. first runs in VSCode may take minutes to load

## imgProcessor.py
modified version of the previewer, to bake frames with blend modes rather than just displaying a frame.

## badAppleBake.gif
output GIF from the image processor. this file is brought to photoshop for final compression. way too large for discord
