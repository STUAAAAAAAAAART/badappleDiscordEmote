LICENSE OF THE BAD APPLE VIDEO

----

although the file is converted to a 100fps 128x128 sequence from a 30fps 480x360 video with naiive optical flow interpolation from premiere pro, along with some manual edits to certain pre-processed frames, plus some edits to the shot before the yin-yang spinner to better fit the square canvas, **the author of this repo does not believe this is transformative enough to provide said intermediary frames as-is for copyright concerns.**

in lieu of said sequence, this file will instead describe the contents of the intermediary files in this folder:
